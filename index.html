        Coffee is one of the three most popular beverages in the world (alongside water and tea) and one of the most profitable international commodities.
        Though coffee is the basis for an endless array of beverages, including espresso, cappuccinos, mochas, and lattes, its popularity is mainly attributed to its invigorating effect, which is produced by caffeine, an alkaloid present in coffee.
